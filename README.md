Experimenting with advanced type systems, featuring Closed type classes, i.e. type classes whose members are known at declaration time to allow for exhaustive pattern matching.

Planned:

- [ ] Pattern Matching closed type classes
- [ ] Simple generic type constructors

Maybe Planned:

- [ ] Generic Functors aka. Module Generics รก la Ocaml
- [ ] Refinement Types

Implemented:
- [x] Bi-Directional Type Checker allowing for large scale inference just from top-level annotation
- [x] Closed Type Classes
- [x] Variant Polymorphism, allowing closed type classes to declare multiple variants and conditionally compile types and methods based on those variants
- [x] Functions as first-class objects
- [x] Partial Function Application and Currying
- [x] Full algebraic data types, including pattern matching on union types
- [x] Simple and mutual function recursion
- [x] Recursive data types


Current progress: This program **runs**
